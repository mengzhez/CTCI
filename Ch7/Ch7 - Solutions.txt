In the first game, the winning probability is P1 = p.
In the second game, the winning probability is P2 = (C32 * p^2 * (1-p)) = 3p^2(1-p).
By comparing P1 and P2, we will get when p is in ((3 - sqrt(5)) / 2, (3 + sqrt(5)) / 2), we pick up Game 2, otherwise Game 1.

Each ant has two options to start walking. So if there are n ants, the total number of choices is 2^n. However, there are only two choices that none of the ants will collide with others (all of them walk on the clockwise direction or counterclockwise).
So the probability of collision is (2^n - 2) / 2^n.

If we have the equations of these two lines, we could check their slopes to determine whether they are parallel with each other. If so, they do not intersect, otherwise yes.

Implementation should include bits shift to make the algorithm more efficient.
